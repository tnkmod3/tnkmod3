					<p> As a young professional a lot of things have evolved from what they used to be. Kody Stokes was born in a small town outside of the city of Peoria. Though it was a farm town, he still loved technology. Kody would always want to be on the computer, making games or browsing the internet to learn new things. </p>
					<p> Although he went to school in Brimfield through his sophomore year, Kody changed schools during his junior and senior year. They didn't have as many opportunities to learn about technology. A year after he graduated from high school he started in the Year Up program. His passion has always been coding, but Kody has learned to expand his horizons into software as well as a bit of hardware. </p>
					<p> Kody's general hobbies include competitive video gaming, fencing, and swimming. Kody Stokes currently lives in Chicago, IL attending the Year Up program and is growing professionally and participating in closing the opportunity divide. </p>
