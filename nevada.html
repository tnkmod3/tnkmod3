					<p>Nevada Sparks is a quiet, laid back, and sincere individual. Born on the South Side, Chicago, he spent only a few years there until moving to his great-grandmother house in Gary, Indiana. There Nevada started in his path of education at one of the top day cares of the city. His family moved back to Chicago shortly after where Nevada excelled in the school "Walter Reed". Seeing that he needed a challenge, Nevada's mother transferred him to school after school. </p>
					<p>In his middle school years, Nevada had decided what he wanted to do as a career. The career he chose was Game Design which his family did not approve of at that point of time. Still being very determined, he continued seeking information about this choice. By high school, Nevada had a clear plan about what he wanted to do in life. Sadly, he found out that life doesn't go as planned and has many ups and downs. </p>
					<p>Now Nevada is currently enrolled in the Year Up program getting his life back together. He still enjoys his hobbies of reading, writing, and drawing when he has the time to enjoy them. Nevada still has a desire to become a Game Designer, but has deterred it, for the moment, as he is trying to find a way into the industry since conventional schooling did not work out. After the program, Nevada has decided to, "Go the path life takes him." </p>
